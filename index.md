Welcome! I'm **Ilham Mneimneh**, holding a Bioinformatics BSc with High Distinction from the Lebanese American University with a strong foundation in genomics, structural biochemistry, and multi-omics data integration.

I specialize in applying computational techniques to biological challenges, particularly in the areas of:
- **Genome annotation and phylogenetics**
- **Transcriptomics and RNA-seq analysis**
- **Structural domain modeling**
- **Pipeline automation using R, Bash, and Python**

I am currently a research assistant at LAU's **Microbial Genomics Lab**, where I lead bioinformatics analysis for parasitic diseases and drug repositioning projects. Iâ€™ve contributed to three submitted publications, including a peer-reviewed study on **Halzoun Syndrome** and ongoing work on **Leishmaniasis therapeutics**.

### Highlights
- Developed R/Bash pipelines to process **10,000+ SARS-CoV-2 genomes** from GISAID
- Integrated **genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data** to study ROBO1/3 in leukemic progression
- Led interdisciplinary **bioinformatics workshops** for undergraduates and graduates
- Co-founded **Humanized.i**, a mental health initiative promoting science communication in the Arab world
